As an extroverted data visionary and excellent communicator, I thrive at the intersection of people, data, technology, and business. I'm adept at simplifying complex technical concepts for diverse audiences, leveraging my unique skill set to initiate strategic insights and innovative solutions.

In my free time, I enjoy reading non-fiction books and researching the latest trends in tech and business while drinking coffee. I also enjoy watching football games and soccer matches, backpacking, traveling abroad, playing guitar, playing video games, tasting wine, and cooking a wide variety of cuisines!
