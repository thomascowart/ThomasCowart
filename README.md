In my free time, I enjoy drinking coffee while researching the latest trends in tech and business as well as reading non-fiction books related to economics and social pyschology. I also enjoy watching football games and soccer matches, backpacking, traveling abroad, playing guitar, playing video games, tasting wine, and cooking a wide variety of cuisines!
