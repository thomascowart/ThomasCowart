Hi, I'm Thomas, a Navy veteran and dedicated student of Business Analytics and Information Systems with over four years of technical experience as an IT Support Specialist. As an excellent communicator and extroverted data visionary, I'm adept at simplifying complex technical concepts for diverse audiences. I thrive at the intersection of data, technology, people, and business, leveraging my skills to drive innovative solutions and strategic insights.

In my free time, I enjoy reading non-fiction books and researching the latest trends in business and technology while drinking coffee. I also enjoy watching football games and soccer matches, hiking, camping, traveling abroad, playing guitar, playing video games, and cooking a wide variety of cuisines!
