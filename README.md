As a dedicated student of Business Analytics and Information Systems and a Navy veteran, I bring over four years of robust experience in analytics and information technology. I am an excellent communicator and extroverted data enthusiast, skilled at explaining complex technical concepts to people from diverse backgrounds and varying levels of expertise. I have a strong passion for business intelligence and data analytics, and I enjoy sharing insights with others.

In my free time, I enjoy reading non-fiction books and researching the latest trends in business and technology while drinking coffee. I also enjoy watching football games and soccer matches, hiking, camping, traveling abroad, playing guitar, playing video games, and cooking a variety of foods!
